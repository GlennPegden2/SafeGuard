# SafeGuard

Another part of my ongoing project to rescue my 8/16-bit unpublished source.
This is my Acorn Archmiedes Virus Scanner. It actually detected more viruses that the biggest product on the market (though it didn't remove them like the vprotect did). Sadly I haven't yet recovered the source (thats still on a SCSI-1 disk that needs recovering).
